# so_long

## Overview

`so_long` is a graphical project developed as part of the 42 curriculum. It involves creating a simple 2D game using the MiniLibX library, where a player can move around a map, collect items, and reach an exit.

## Features

- Player can move up, down, left, and right.
- Collectible items on the map.
- An exit that the player must reach to win the game.
- Simple graphical interface using MiniLibX.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run `so_long`, you will need:

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS).
- `gcc` or `clang` compiler.
- `make` build system.
- MiniLibX library.

### What is MiniLibX
MinilibX is fundamentally a simple API. It is built on the X-Window system, which, in basic terms, 
  is the foundation that enables graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to operate on UNIX-like operating systems.
  
It's a compact library that provides basic functions for quickly opening a window and drawing within it.

Specifically, it abstracts the 'X Window System' for Unix-based platforms.
## About X-Window
X-Window is a network-oriented graphical system for Unix.
It allows for remote desktop connections, similar to how TeamViewer operates.
